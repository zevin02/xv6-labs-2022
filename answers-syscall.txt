Q:Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
A:usertrap()

Q:What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
A:p->trapframe->a7 =7,系统调用对应的系统调用号

Q:What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
A:the previous mode that the CPU was in unprivileged mode

Q:Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the varialable num?
A:800020b0:	00002903          	lw	s2,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>,s2

Q:Why does the kernel crash? Hint: look at figure 3-3 in the text; is address 0 mapped in the kernel address space? 
Is that confirmed by the value in scause above? (See description of scause in RISC-V privileged instructions)

A:.0并没有映射到内核页标的任何位置，无法对其进行去地址，获得这个地址的内容

Q:What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
